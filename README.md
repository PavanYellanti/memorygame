## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## What have I done?

1.  With the help of Vanilla JS, I have performed the DOM manipulations, and I have added some new styles to this game.
2.  I have done the following steps

-   I created a deck of cards that will get shuffled when the game is refreshed(i.e, when we click the reload button).
-   I created a counter to count the number of moves when the cards are being clicked while playing the game.
-   I created a timer to know the duration of the game that triggers when the first two cards are being clicked.
-   I have added some special effects to the cards, when the two cards are matched, they will change their color to green. When  the cards are unmatched, they will change their color to red
-   When the player wins the game, a pop-up message is displayed saying "Congratulations".
-   I have added stars to depict the perfection of play by the player.

3.        Hence the project has been implemented successfully.

# Conclusion:-

In this project I have combined my skills that I have learnt in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have performed DOM Manipulations by using the Vanilla JS so that, it meets all the specifications.
